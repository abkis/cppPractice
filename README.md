# cppPractice
This repository will be used to publish what I have done to practice C++17

I am using the textbook Beginning C++17, 5th edition, by Ivor Horton and Peter Van Weert, to study.
As such any files under this repository in which I am solving exercizes from this book will be labelled as such (ie with a comment/description
which indicates the chapter and question number).
Any unlabelled files include problems which I created for myself, although I may have been inspired by others/the book.
Unless stated otherwise, I wrote all the code myself, from scratch.
